# Solar System 3D Simulation with Unity

Welcome to the Solar System 3D Simulation project! In this project, I have created an immersive 3D simulation of our solar system using Unity, a popular game development engine, and Visual Studio for scripting in C#. This simulation allows you to explore and learn about the celestial bodies that make up our solar system.

## Project Overview

- **[ITCH.IO Link](https://harshul811.itch.io/2d-shooter)**: [https://harshul811.itch.io/2d-shooter](https://harshul811.itch.io/2d-shooter)

## Features

- **3D Solar System**: The project showcases an accurate 3D representation of our solar system, complete with planets, moons, and other celestial objects.

- **Interactive Experience**: Users can interact with the simulation, zoom in on planets, and observe their orbits and rotations.

- **Educational Value**: The simulation serves as an educational tool, providing information about each celestial body when selected.

## Technologies Used

- **Unity**: Unity is the game development engine used to create the 3D simulation environment.

- **Visual Studio (C#)**: Visual Studio was employed for scripting in C# to create interactive and dynamic behavior for the celestial objects.

## Getting Started

To experience the Solar System 3D Simulation, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [ITCH.IO link](https://harshul811.itch.io/2d-shooter) to access the simulation.

2. Explore the simulation, enjoy the beauty of our solar system, and expand your knowledge of the cosmos.
